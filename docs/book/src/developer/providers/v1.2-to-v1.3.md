# Cluster API v1.2 compared to v1.3

This document provides an overview over relevant changes between Cluster API v1.2 and v1.3 for
maintainers of providers and consumers of our Go API.

## Minimum Go version

* The Go version used by Cluster API is Go 1.19.x

## Dependencies

**Note**: Only the most relevant dependencies are listed, `k8s.io/` and `ginkgo`/`gomega` dependencies
in Cluster API are kept in sync with the versions used by `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime`.

- sigs.k8s.io/kind: v0.14.x => v0.15.x

## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/controllers/external.CloneTemplate` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/controllers/external.CreateFromTemplate` instead.
- `clusterctl init --list-images` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `clusterctl init list-images` instead.

### Removals

- `MachinesByCreationTimestamp` type has been removed.
- `ClusterCacheReconciler.Log` has been removed. Use the logger from the context instead.

### API Changes

### Other

- e2e tests are upgraded to use Ginkgo v2 (v2.1.4) and Gomega v1.20.0. Providers who use the test framework from this release will also need to upgrade, because Ginkgo v2 can't be imported alongside v1. Please see the [Ginkgo upgrade guide](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2), and note:
  * the default test timeout has been [changed to 1h](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2#timeout-behavior)
  * the `--junit-report` argument [replaces JUnit custom reporter](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2#improved-reporting-infrastructure) code
  * see the ["Update tests to Ginkgo v2" PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/6906) for a reference example
- Custer API introduced new [logging guidelines](../../developer/logging.md). All reconcilers in the core repository were updated
  to [log the entire object hierarchy](../../developer/logging.md#keyvalue-pairs). It would be great if providers would be adjusted 
  as well to make it possible to cross-reference log entries across providers (please see CAPD for an infra provider reference implementation).
